Lane Keep Assist System
 
Welcome to the Lane Keep Assist System repository! This project aims to implement a computer vision-based lane detection system using a variety of image processing techniques. Our pipeline includes color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Transform line detection.

Tools Used:
Color Selection: Identify and isolate relevant colors in the image to enhance lane detection.
Region of Interest Selection: Define a specific region in the image where lane lines are expected to appear.
Grayscaling: Convert the image to grayscale for simpler processing and analysis.
Gaussian Smoothing: Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of subsequent edge detection.
Canny Edge Detection: Detect edges in the image to highlight potential lane boundaries.
Hough Transform Line Detection: Identify line segments in the image and extrapolate them to form continuous lane lines.
Goal:
Our primary objective is to piece together a robust pipeline that can effectively detect lane line segments in the input image. The next step involves averaging and extrapolating these line segments to create smooth, continuous lane lines. Finally, these lines are drawn onto the original image for visual display, providing a clear representation of the detected lane boundaries.
